# Wiki Index — Robotics & Robot Learning

A wiki compiled from research papers on robot manipulation, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and foundation models for robotics. Built in parallel with experiments on the SO-100 robot arm.

**New here?** Start with [[overview]] — it explains the three paradigm families and how to navigate the wiki.  
**Choosing an approach?** Go directly to [[decision-guide]] for the decision flowchart and comparison tables.
**Want the experimental results directly?** Go to [[results]] for the SO-100 results dashboard.
