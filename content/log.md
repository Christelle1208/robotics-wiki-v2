## [2026-07-20] ingest | SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation

Created new algo page [[algo-sarm]] (ICLR 2026). Key contribution: semantic task decomposition + RA-BC data filtering outperforms vanilla BC on long-horizon contact-rich IL. Main results: T-shirt folding 83% from flattened, 67% from crumpled (vs 0-8% vanilla BC). Updated [[imitation-learning]] status table (ACT/SmolVLA marked ✅ Done), added "Data Quality & Reward Modeling" synthesis note flagging SARM as addressing quality bottleneck. Updated [[grasping-and-manipulation]] contact-rich section to include SARM as emerging solution for deformable object manipulation. Added to [[index.md]] algorithm table. Integrated into lint-report metrics.

## [2026-07-15] correction | Dataset_v5 episode count fixed to 131
Corrected Dataset_v5 total from an earlier mistaken ~111/121 estimate to the actual 131 episodes, and filled in the v5 row of the dataset iteration table (section 2) with its real composition: 60 ID (fixed orientation, split by row), 24 variable-orientation, 10 lighting-change, 12 distractor (scissors), 15 recovery, 10 combined lighting+distractor+recovery. Flagged that several of these training-time variations (distractor object, lighting delta, recovery scenarios) overlap in kind with conditions tested at evaluation time — a near-OOD validity caveat already discussed in [[evaluation-protocol]] (e.g. the eval distractor object must differ from the training distractor to count as genuine near-OOD, which it does here: training used scissors, evaluation used pink tape / blue object).

## [2026-07-15] rex-update | SmolVLA Dataset_v5 expanded evaluation added; ACT far-OOD/distractor axes reclassified
Added section 6 to results.md: SmolVLA run through the same Dataset_v5 axis-structured protocol as ACT (~260 trials). Headline: big jump over Dataset_v4 (82-98% vs 25-58% on ID/near-OOD) but still behind ACT on the same protocol; a directional weakness where SmolVLA fails specifically on backward cube displacement (toward the object's base); far-OOD target test (green/yellow brick, no cube present) mirrors ACT's conditioning-avoidance failure on green (0%) but shows partial engagement with yellow (25% vs ACT's 0%). Corrected a misclassification in ACT's section 5: the "blue object" test is a distractor (cube remains the grasp target, blue object placed alongside it), not a far-OOD target-replacement test as originally logged — reclassified from Far-OOD to Near/Far-OOD distractor axis, with green/yellow brick confirmed as the true far-OOD target test (brick is the sole object in the workspace). Updated headline summary and cross-algorithm comparison table (now section 7) with completed SmolVLA v5 row. Rewrote "What's not yet measured" to reflect both algorithms now sharing the same axis set, remaining gaps: N<30 on lighting/distractor for both, color-confound in the green-brick far-OOD test, SmolVLA's directional displacement weakness untested across other directions, human-intervention perturbation still untested for either algorithm.

## [2026-07-09] rex-update | ACT Dataset_v5 expanded evaluation integrated into results.md
Added new section 5 to results.md: 252-trial axis-structured ACT evaluation (Dataset_v5) covering ID (fixed/random orientation), near-OOD (position, orientation, lighting, distractor), far-OOD (color-confusable novel object), and perturbation (mid-task displacement, camera occlusion — full vs brief). Key findings: strong ID/near-OOD spatial generalization (75-100%); distractor test confounded by color similarity to target (pink tape, 41.7-50% success, not neutral-object robustness); recovery is perception-gated not motor-gated (100% recovery when vision available or briefly restored, 0% with full-episode occlusion). Updated headline summary, cross-algorithm comparison table (renumbered to section 6), and "What's not yet measured" to flag: SmolVLA not yet run on the v5 axis set, lighting/distractor below N=30 target, need for a genuinely color-neutral far-OOD object, human-intervention perturbation untested.

Updated index.md (algo table, source summary, wiki-status table).

## [2026-06-24] wiki-update | evaluation-protocol.md — 5 structural upgrades
Rewrote evaluation-protocol.md with: (1) unified column names across all axis tables (Near-OOD, Far-OOD, Perturbation all now use consistent `Notes` column); (2) moved Expected impact / What failure reveals out of protocol tables into a new "Expected outcome profiles by algorithm family" section at the end, pairing predictions with current results per axis; (3) added SO-100 training zone definition (4×4 grid of 6×4cm squares = 24×16cm total, 12/16 squares used for training, 4 held-out for near-OOD, orientations 0° and 45° only) with OOD thresholds expressed as % of training coverage; (4) added Statistical Reporting section with Wilson score interval formula, reference table for common (N, success rate) pairs, and explicit rules on when results are inferential vs characterization-only; (5) added trial count justification table (50 ID / 30 near-OOD / 20 far-OOD with power/CI rationale) and Model Training Context table (ACT: 1×A10G g5.2xlarge 4h28m10s / SmolVLA: 4×A10G g5.12xlarge 2h41m01s / SAC: TBD) with interpretive note on pretrained vs from-scratch compute.

## [2026-06-15] wiki-add | algo-smolvla.md, results.md, and home-page status overview
Created algo-smolvla.md: architecture (SmolVLM-2 backbone + flow-matching action expert), a 4-option fine-tuning comparison table (A: action-expert-only/frozen backbone, B: frozen vision encoder only, C: full fine-tuning — used in this project, D: LoRA/QLoRA backbone + full expert), advantages/disadvantages, and a "Results in This Project" section comparing SmolVLA vs ACT on Dataset_v4. Proposed a follow-up hypothesis: SmolVLA's 0% distractor result may stem from full fine-tuning (Option C) eroding pretrained robustness — Option A/B is the suggested next experiment. Added matching "Results in This Project" section to algo-act.md. Created results.md: a consolidated results dashboard (SAC sim 92%, ACT 83-94%, SmolVLA 58%/0% distractor, PPO vs SAC, dataset v1-v4 iteration table, cross-algorithm comparison, "what's not yet measured" section). Restructured index.md (home page): added a "📊 Wiki Status — At a Glance" table giving an ensemble view of every major page with coverage/status (✅ complete vs 🔄 reference-only), added results.md to Navigation & Synthesis Pages and the algorithm table. Updated vision-language-action-models.md: linked SmolVLA entry to algo-smolvla, updated the SO-100 experiments table from "pending" to real results with outcome-vs-hypothesis analysis.
