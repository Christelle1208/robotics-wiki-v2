# Grasping and Manipulation

Robotic grasping is the act of securing an object with a gripper or hand. 6-DoF grasping predicts the full 6-degree-of-freedom pose (position + orientation) of the gripper. Beyond simple grasping, manipulation covers dexterous multi-step interactions: assembly, bimanual coordination, and in-hand re-orientation.

## Synthesis — Grasping and Manipulation Approaches

Grasping sits at the boundary between perception and control. The right approach depends heavily on whether the task requires **geometric precision** (6-DoF pose estimation, peg insertion) or **semantic flexibility** (grasp any object of type X).

### Key distinctions

**Free-space grasping vs contact-rich manipulation**
Free-space P&P grasping (pick an object from a clear surface, place elsewhere) is well-solved by RL and IL. Contact-rich tasks (assembly, insertion, wiping, surgical procedures) are fundamentally harder — see the [[imitation-learning#contact-rich-survey]] for why. Contact dynamics are nonlinear, force feedback is essential, and tactile sensors remain research-only hardware.

**Structured vs unstructured environments**
In structured environments (fixed bin, known objects, consistent lighting), RL and task-specific IL achieve 80–90%+ success. In unstructured environments (cluttered bins, varied objects, arbitrary positions), VLAs and 6-DoF geometric grasping methods (Transformer + TSDF) are needed.

### Which approach for which grasping task

| Task | Recommended approach | Why |
|------|---------------------|-----|
| Simple P&P, fixed objects | SAC / ACT | Well-covered; see [[pick-and-place]] |
| Cluttered environments | DQN + non-prehensile (push + grasp) | Objects need isolation before grasping |
| Arbitrary object shapes, 6-DoF pose | Transformer + TSDF (geometric) | Predicts full 6-DoF from 3D geometry |
| Bimanual, dexterous assembly | ACT / HITL-RL | ACT handles coordination; HITL-RL for precision |
| Contact-rich (insertion, polishing) | Force-coupled IL (DMP + force BC) | Requires force/torque feedback data |
| Language-conditioned ("grasp the X") | VLA (SmolVLA, GF-VLA) | Semantic understanding required |

### The contact-rich gap

The most important open challenge in manipulation is contact-rich tasks: assembly, peg-in-hole, surface polishing, surgical procedures — especially deformable object manipulation (cloth, rope, foam). These require:
1. Force/torque feedback (not just position)
2. Tactile sensing for fine-grained contact (still mostly research hardware)
3. Sub-millimeter precision that VLAs currently cannot provide
4. Handling of variable geometry (deformable objects don't have fixed end-states)

**Current best approaches:**
- Force-coupled DMPs, ACT with force augmentation (Bi-ACT, Comp-ACT), and HITL-RL for precision assembly
- [[algo-sarm]] (ICLR 2026) for deformable object IL: semantic reward modeling + RA-BC data filtering achieves 67% on T-shirt folding from crumpled state (vs 0% vanilla BC) by filtering suboptimal demonstrations automatically

VLAs are advancing but still weak on both precision and deformable dynamics.

## 6-DoF Grasping

### Bio-Inspired Affordance Learning for 6-DoF Robotic Grasping: A Transformer-Based Global Feature Encoding Approach
**2025**

Uses a **Transformer-based architecture** to predict 6-DoF grasp poses from **TSDF (Truncated Signed Distance Function)** voxel inputs — a 3D representation derived from depth images. Inspired by biological affordance perception: the model learns which parts of an object's geometry afford grasping.

Key contributions:
- Global feature encoding via Transformers (captures long-range geometric relationships)
- TSDF input representation (stable 3D geometry without normals estimation)
- Outperforms VGN (Volumetric Grasping Network) benchmark
- Demonstrated on Franka Panda robot

## Contact-Rich Manipulation

### A Survey on Imitation Learning for Contact-Rich Tasks in Robotics
**Tsuji, Kato, Solak, Zhang, Petrič, Nori, Ajoudani — IJRR, 2026**

Comprehensive survey of IL for tasks requiring continuous physical interaction. Directly relevant to manipulation: covers assembly, peg-in-hole, insertion, polishing, deburring, cloth manipulation, surgical tasks. Key finding: contact-rich tasks are fundamentally harder than free-space manipulation because:
- Small positional deviations cause large behavioral changes
- Visual observation misses contact forces (occlusion at contact point)
- Tactile sensors needed but remain mostly research-only hardware

**Recommended IL approaches by manipulation type:**
- Precision assembly (peg-in-hole): force-coupled DMPs or BC with force features
- Dexterous / household tasks: diffusion policy or ACT with tactile/force augmentation
- Long-horizon contact sequences: hierarchical VLAs or Mamba-based temporal models
